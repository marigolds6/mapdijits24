		<h3 class="heading">Find Your Location</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Center on your location</strong>
				<ol><em>Unincorporated or Contract Munis</em>
					<li>Select your current Beat Plan</li>
					<li>Select your Beat</li>
					<li>Map will automatically zoom into your beat</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<ul><em>Other areas</em>
					<li>Move mouse over the map</li>
					<li>Zoom in with +</li>
					<li>Zoom out with -</li>
					<li>Move around the map with the arrow keys</li>
					<li>Zoom to a box by holding down shift and touch/click and dragging. You should see a red box that will be your zoom area.</li>
					<li>You can also zoom in and out using the slider on the left hand side of the screen.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<br>
			<div><strong>Need to zoom back out to start?</strong></div>
				<div>Click the globe button.</div>
			<div><strong>Want to see aerial photos with the property boundaries and roads?</strong></div>
				<ol>
					<li>In the top right corner of the map, click on "Switch Basemap". This will expand the basemap selection window.</li>
					<li>Click on "Satellite" to turn on aerial photos (currently from 2010). To switch back to street map only, select "Street".</li>
					<li>Click on "Switch Basemap" again to minimize the basemap selection window.</li>
				</ol>
			<br>
			<li><strong>Zoom to edit level to record damage</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Do this by clicking the Zoom to parcel button.</li>
					<li>You can zoom in closer and still edit, but if you zoom out farther, editing will be disabled until you zoom back in.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

		<h3 class="heading">Record Damage</h3>
		<div><em>You must be at one of the <span class="red">Edit</span> zoom levels (top 4 notches on the zoom slider).<br>If you are zoomed out too far, damage recording will be disabled.</em></div>
		<br>
		<div><strong>To change the record for a property, tap it once.</strong></div>
		<div>
			<ol><em>As you touch each property, it cycles through three states.</em>
				<li>Green - No Damage.</li>
				<li>Red - Damage. This includes all levels of damage from shingles missing to house levelled.</li>
				<li>Blue - Clear record. <em>ONLY USE THIS TO CORRECT MISTAKES</em>.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div>Double-clicking/double-tapping will advance the property two steps on the cycle.</div>
		<br/>	
		<div><strong>Select by line</strong></div>
		<ol><em>You can also change a whole group of properties at once.</em>
			<li>Touch "Select by Line" and the button changes to "Drawing..." to show you are in draw mode.</li>
			<li>Trace a line over the properties you want to change. Each property touched by the line will cycle up one state.</li>
			<li>The line can loop and overlap itself, but will only advance each property once per trace.</li>
			<ul><em>Example</em>:
				<li>Trace a line through two clear properties and two green properties.</li>
				<li>The two clear properties will change to green and the two green properties to red.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul><em>Example</em>:
				<li>To mark an entire clear block damaged, choose Select by Line and trace through each property in the block. All the properties will turn green.</li>
				<li>Choose Select by Line again and trace through all the green properties again. All of those properties will now turn blue.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>You can correct mistakes by clicking individual properties until they are at the right state.</li>
		</ol>

		<div><strong>Sending reports</strong></div>
		<ol><em>Once you have finished recording damaged and undamaged properties, you still need to send your reports.</em>
			<li>Click the "Send Reports" button.</li>
			<li>Next to the button you will see a message that says "Sending # Reports.", where # is the number of properties you have changed.</li>
			<li>When the changes are sent, that message will change to "Done." Wait until you see this message before recording more damage.</li>
		</ol>
